<p>Keypoints:</br>
I used Sift to detect my keypoints. I used Sift since I think it was more simple to understand. Basically in order to detect features the different algorithms look for corners in a  image. I choosed for the image to be gray since it seems to be generally much simpler to work with. In order to get the orientation of the Different keypoints I had to set a flag for the draw keypoints function. 
</br>
Matching:</br>
For matching I used Sift to detect the keypoints. Then I used the flannBasedMatcher instead of the provided bruteforce matcher. This matcher operates faster  since it does not generally have to go through all the points one by one. Instead I believe it goes through nLog(n) points.
I choose to keep the threshold as is.If the threshold was increased more keypoints would be found. I choose to keep it at a minimum.
</br>
All Matching:</br>
My program goes through each permutation of the different images and calculates the  # selected matches based on the threshold.It puts the result into a matrix and then saves it to a txt file using np.
